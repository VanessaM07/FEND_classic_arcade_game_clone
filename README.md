# Arcade-game :video_game:

This is the 5th project for the Udaicty Front-End Web Development Nanodgree. The goal is to create a clone of the classic arcade frogger game using the newly acquired skills in Object Oriented JS and HTML5 Canvas. Images and a game loop engine are provided. The rest should be built in app.js file! The requirements for this projects are:

- The player has to reach the water without colliding into the enemies (bugs).
- The player can move up, down, left and right without falling out of the screen.
- The enemies run on the paved block portion of the scene at various speeds.
- The game resets when the player collides into an enemy.
- When the player reaches the water the game is won.

## How to install it:

To run the application clone the repository to your computer:

```git clone https://github.com/VanessaMollisi/classic_arcade_game_clone.git```

Then open the `index html` in your browser.

You can follow this [link](https://vanessamollisi.github.io/classic_arcade_game_clone/) to play it.

## How to play it:

Use the following keys to move the player:

- Up: *up-arrow* or *W*
- Down: *down-arrow* or *S*
- Left: *left-arrow* or *A*
- Right: *right-arrow* or *D*

You have to get to the water without colliding with the ladybugs. You have three lives, you lose a life when you collide three times. If you lose three lives you'll lose the game. Each time you get to the water you'll score 100 points. Each time you collide you'll lose 50 points. After you score 300 points collectibles will appear. You'll win the game when you score at least 2000 points. When you lose or win the game, a play-again button will appear.

## Enjoy it!! :v:
